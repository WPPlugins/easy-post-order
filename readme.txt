Easy Post Order provides an intuitive sortable / draggable interface for custom-sorting your posts.

== Description ==

Easy Post Order uses WordPress's sortable / draggable interface to allow easy sorting of your posts and custom post types. The interface works very much like a Netflix queue and stores the orders in an unobtrusive custom table.

EPO is seamlessly integrated into the WP_Query model.
Once you enable the plugin, you can use the [EPO] shortcode to sort posts on a page.

EPO uses AJAX in database interaction.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `easy-post-order.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use shortcode [EPO] in your page.
